                whether as a quick breakfast or a snack between
                meals. Packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber, they can be tailored for weight loss by using
                low-calorie ingredients,
                or for muscle gain by adding protein-rich options like Greek yogurt. With endless combinations,
                smoothies offer a
                convenient way to support your health and fitness goals.</p>
            <p class="box2 text-colour-black">Wraps are a versatile and healthy meal option that can be enjoyed at any
                time of day. Whether used for a quick lunch or
                as a light snack, they can be filled with lean proteins, veggies, and whole grains. Wraps are easily
                customizable for
                different goals – opt for low-calorie ingredients for weight loss or add extra protein for muscle gain.
                Their
                portability and endless combinations make wraps a convenient and nutritious choice.</p>
            <p class="box2 text-colour-black">Salmon is a nutrient-dense fish packed with healthy omega-3 fatty acids,
                protein, and essential vitamins. It’s great for
                supporting heart health, muscle recovery, and weight management. Whether grilled, baked, or added to
                salads, salmon can
                fit into any meal. For muscle gain, pair it with healthy carbs, and for weight loss, enjoy it with leafy
                greens or
                veggies. Its rich flavor and health benefits make salmon a top choice for a balanced diet.</p>
